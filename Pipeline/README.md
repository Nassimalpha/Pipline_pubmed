# Drug Mention Graph Builder

This project builds a graph linking **drugs** to their mentions in:
- **Scientific publications** (PubMed)
- **Clinical trials** (Clinical Trials)

Each connection is annotated with:
- the **publication date**
- the **journal name**

##  Objective

> Identify drug mentions through the titles of publications and trials, and generate a structured JSON graph representing the relationships between drugs, journals, and dates.

##  Business Rules

- A **drug** is considered mentioned if its name appears in the **title** of a publication or clinical trial.
- A **journal** is linked to a drug if it published a **mentioning article**.

##  How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main pipeline script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. The output is saved as:
   ```
   output/graph.json
   ```

## Input Data

- `drugs.csv` â€“ list of drugs
- `pubmed.csv` & `pubmed.json` â€“ scientific publications
- `clinical_trials.csv` â€“ clinical trial metadata

##  Cleaning Process

- Dates are normalized to `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Duplicate entries (`title + journal + date`) are removed
- Missing data is flagged or kept based on configuration

## ðŸ“¦Output Format

A JSON file representing the graph:

```json
[
  {
    "drug": "aspirin",
    "mentions": [
      {
        "source": "pubmed",
        "journal": "the lancet",
        "date": "2020-05-03",
        "title": "aspirin reduces heart attack"
      },
      {
        "source": "clinical_trials",
        "journal": "nejm",
        "date": "2019-11-10",
        "title": "clinical effect of aspirin in stroke"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
